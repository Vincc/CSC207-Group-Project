# CSC207-Group-Project

problem domain: social and sports 

The primary objective of this project is to develop an application designed to facilitate connections
and sports participation among individuals. When a group of people wants to engage in a specific sport but
lacks sufficient participants at the moment, they can create a group within the application. 
For instance, if they want to play soccer at 13:00 at the Harthouse field, they can create a group
for that purpose. Nearby individuals in the area will then have the opportunity to join this group
and participate in the sporting activity.
